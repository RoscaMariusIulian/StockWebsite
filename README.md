# StockWebsite

Things I tried to learn with this was were more database related. The website uses the LAMP stack with an OracleDB and the leasons were about Triggers, Procedures and Packets. But as a challenge I tried to learn more about Front End and Web Design especially the flexbox. The website uses the alphavantage API to pull the stock market data.

Small preview of the website:
